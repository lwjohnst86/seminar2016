Story:
- My story of how I went from NEFA -> to all fractions, how coding was the thing
that allowed this to happen
- Draw in coding, my code, show the code (maybe)

Outline:
- Title
- Revised title (after learning coding)
- blank (brief talk about coding and doing more fractions, gaps in lit)
- image of lipoprotein, describe lipid fractions (phys draw it first)
- image of beta-cells + insulin signaling, how lipids can influence these (phys draw it first)
- previous lit? brief
- Objectives (I already mentioned gaps at start), emph exploratory nature
    - Briefly mention NEFA, PL, CE fraction results, state going over TAG
- PROMISE
- Statistics
    - GEE
    - p-values (getting around that using FDR)
    - PLS
    - CV
- Code (image of Nature news articles, the two of them), link to GitHub
- Results
- Image of GEE models (non-FDR vs FDR pval < 0.05)
- Image of PLS results (with cor of predictive)
- (optional) Other images? Of other fractions?
- Interpretation (?)
- Implication/conclusion

- Emphasize TAG pool and associations with outcomes + MetS components
- Briefly mention other pools
- Go over TAG biology briefly
- Go through number of GEE models and how FDR reduces false discovery
- Show TAG GEE and PLS results for outcomes
- Try to describe PLS as best I can and how techniques like these are very
powerful, especially for prediction

## Original title
- Revised title (after learning coding)

## Physiology of serum lipid fractions

```{r lipid_pools}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/lipid-fractions.pdf')
```

## Glucose metabolism

```{r glucose_metabolism}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/glucose-metabolism.pdf')
```

## Previous literature

## Objectives:

Explore associations of fatty acid composition of serum lipid fractions on
diabetes pathogenesis:

<!-- Emphasis exploration. "in many ways, my research is like an astronomer
looking at the sky trying to make sense of it all. Many of the fatty acids I
examine don't have a well defined physiological role as several are difficult to
experimentally study"

The last seminar I presented three of the lipid fractions, which I'll briefly
mention the results here, but I hadn't finished analyzing the TAG fraction. This
is the fraction which I will be showing today.

. . .

>- NEFA: *Higher total NEFA, not individual fatty acids, contribute to lower
beta-cell function*
>- PL: *Higher palmitic acid associates with **declines** in beta-cell function
over time. Higher cis-vaccenic acid associated with higher insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function.*
>- CE: *No strong associates with diabetes pathogenesis*
>- TAG: ...

## Data source: The PROMISE cohort

PROspective Metabolism and ISlet cell Evaluation cohort.

- Recruited from London and Toronto centers
- Followed every ~3 years (3 time points completed)
- Demographics, lifestyle, anthropometrics, and blood

## Variables of interest

### Metabolic outcomes

Calculated from OGTT:

- Insulin sensitivity: 1/HOMA-IR, ISI
- Beta-cell function: IGI/HOMA-IR, ISSI-2

. . .

### TAG fatty acids

Thin layer chromatography to split the lipid fractions, gas chromatography for
the fatty acids:

- 22 TAG fatty acids

## Statistical analysis code: https://github.com/lwjohnst86/seminar2016

. . .

```{r img_share_code, out.width='250px', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/share-code.png')
```

```{r img_github_science, out.width='250px', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/github-science.png')
```

## Statistical analysis: Generalized estimating equations (GEE)

- Allow for longitudinal design
- Similar to linear regression
- Variables GEE model:
    - Visit number, waist size, baseline age, ethnicity, sex, ALT (marker of
    liver fat), physical activity (MET), and total NEFA
    - Time-*independent*: TAGFA, NEFA, baseline age, ethnicity, sex

. . .

>- Concern: multiple models will be computed = more p-values
>- P-values: generally unreliable, misunderstood, and inflated with more tests[^1]
>- Adjust using False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction

[^1]: See the [American Statistical Association statement on it](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)

```{r gee_model}
fit <- analyze_gee()
num_sig <- paste0(nrow(dplyr::filter(fit, unadj.p.value < 0.05)),
                  " non-FDR vs ",
                  nrow(dplyr::filter(fit, p.value < 0.05)),
                  " FDR")
```

## As nmol/mL, strong negative association with IS (note: `r num_sig`)

```{r gee_model_conc, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5}
fit %>% 
    dplyr::filter(unit %in% c('Totals', 'nmol/mL')) %>% 
    plot_gee_main()
```

## As mol%, very different story --- different FA have positive or negative roles

```{r gee_model_mol, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5}
fit %>% 
    dplyr::filter(unit %in% c('Totals', 'mol%')) %>% 
    plot_gee_main()
```

## But... GEE modeling is flawed

- TAG fatty acid composition in inherently multivariate

. . .

```{r fig_fattyacid_dnl}
grViz_Rmd("
digraph {
    node [shape = none]
    subgraph {
    rank = min; '14:0'; '16:0'; '18:0'; '20:0'
    }
    subgraph {
    rank = max; '14:1n7'; '16:1n7'; '18:1n9'
    }
    '14:0' -> {'16:0', '14:1n7'}; '16:0' -> {'18:0', '16:1n7'}
    '18:0' -> {'18:1n9', '20:0'}; '14:1n7' -> '16:1n7'
}
")
```

<!-- since each model can only include one TAG fatty acid, it ignores the
inherent fact that fatty acids can be converted from one length or saturation to
another through DNL. And so they are inherently linked to one another -->

## Correlation between TAG fatty acids

```{r fig_heatmap, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5}
analyze_corr() %>% 
    plot_heatmap()
```


## Partial Least Squares (PLS) allows for multivariate data

Takes:

$$ISI = 140 + 141n7 + ... + 225n3$$

Converts to:

$$ISI = Comp1 + Comp2$$

. . .

>- PLS: No p-value, no p-value problem
>- Cross-validation (CV) determines predictability
    - CV splits data into training and test sets
>- Flaw: Can only use one time point (cross-sectional)

## Four long chain fatty acids (14:0, 14:1n-7, 16:0, 16:1n-7) cluster and strongly explain the variance in metabolic function

```{r fig_pls, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
fit_is <- analyze_pls(y = 'lISI', ncomp = 2)
pred_is <- paste0(
    calc_pred_corr(fit_is, fit_is$test_data, ncomp = 1)$r,
    '-',
    calc_pred_corr(fit_is, fit_is$test_data, ncomp = 2)$r
)
fit_bcf <- analyze_pls(y = 'lISSI2', ncomp = 2)
pred_bcf <- paste0(
    calc_pred_corr(fit_bcf, fit_bcf$test_data, ncomp = 1)$r,
    '-',
    calc_pred_corr(fit_bcf, fit_bcf$test_data, ncomp = 2)$r
)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
    plot_pls(fit_is) + ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0('A: ISI\nPredictive: r = ', pred_is)), 
    plot_pls(fit_bcf) + ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0('B: ISSI-2\nPredictive: r = ', pred_bcf)), 
    ncol = 2)
```

## FA involved in DNL from higher carb intake associate with lower metabolic functioning

Previous lit

## Conclusions on observed findings

Each lipid fraction behaves slightly differently on metabolic functioning
