## Original title

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

\textbf{\Large{Serum Composition of Non-Esterified Fatty Acids in the Progression of
Metabolic Abnormalities Underlying Type 2 Diabetes}}

<!-- some introduction.. like "we know diabetes is an important public health
concern" -->

## Physiology of serum lipid fractions

```{r lipid_pools}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/lipid-fractions.pdf')
```

## Glucose and fatty acid metabolism

```{r glucose_metabolism}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/glucose-metabolism.pdf')
```

## Fatty acid length and desaturation

<!-- include image here -->

- Range in length and number of double bonds
- Fatty acids either from diet or *de novo* (DNL)
- Physiological role dependent on molecule
- Eg: higher palmitic acid (16:0) lipotoxic to beta-cells *in vivo* and *in
vitro*[^lit]

## Few large cohorts on fatty acid composition, fraction, and diabetes

- One study had three fractions: TAG, PL, CE[^key]
    - Multiple flaws <!-- stats, design, presentation -->
- Mainly cohorts report on PL and CE: CHS, EPIC, ARIC[^cohorts]
    - 16:0 and 18:0 higher risk for DM
    - 18:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 18:3n-3 lower risk for DM

[^cohorts]: @Wang2003a; @Forouhi2014a; @Kroger2011a; @Ma2015a; @Djousse2011a

## Objectives:

Explore associations of fatty acid composition of serum lipid fractions on
diabetes pathogenesis:

<!-- Emphasis exploration. "in many ways, my research is like an astronomer
looking at the sky trying to make sense of it all. Many of the fatty acids I
examine don't have a well defined physiological role as several are difficult to
experimentally study"

The last seminar I presented three of the lipid fractions, which I'll briefly
mention the results here, but I hadn't finished analyzing the TAG fraction. This
is the fraction which I will be showing today.

. . .

>- NEFA: *Higher total NEFA, not individual fatty acids, contribute to lower
beta-cell function*
>- PL: *Higher palmitic acid associates with **declines** in beta-cell function 
over time. Higher cis-vaccenic acid associated with higher insulin sensitivity
and beta-cell function.*
>- CE: *No strong associates with diabetes pathogenesis*
>- TAG: ...

## Data source: The PROMISE cohort

\vspace{-3cm}
\raggedleft\includegraphics[width=0.11\textwidth]{../img/promise.jpg}

### PROspective Metabolism and ISlet cell Evaluation cohort.

- Recruited from London and Toronto centers
- Followed every ~3 years (3 time points completed)
- Demographics, lifestyle, anthropometrics, and blood

##

```{r consort, fig.align='center', out.height='250px'}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/consort.pdf')
```

## Variables of interest

### Metabolic outcomes

Calculated from OGTT:

- Insulin sensitivity: 1/HOMA-IR, ISI
- Beta-cell function: IGI/HOMA-IR, ISSI-2

. . .

Median declines of `r calc_outcome_changes()$chg`

. . .

### TAG fatty acids

Thin layer chromatography to split the lipid fractions, gas chromatography for
the fatty acids:

- 22 TAG fatty acids, as concentration (nmol/mL) and percent of total (mol%)

## TAG fatty acid composition within PROMISE

```{r tagfa, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
plot_tagfa()
```


## Statistical analysis code: https://github.com/lwjohnst86/seminar2016

. . .

```{r img_share_code, out.width='250px', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/share-code.png')
```

```{r img_github_science, out.width='250px', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/github-science.png')
```

## Statistical analysis: Generalized estimating equations (GEE)

<!-- similar to linear regression but allows for longitudinal design -->

Variables GEE model:

> Visit number, waist size, baseline age, ethnicity, sex, ALT (marker of liver
fat), physical activity (MET), and total NEFA.

Time-*independent*: TAGFA, NEFA, baseline age, ethnicity, sex

. . .

>- Concern: multiple models will be computed
>- P-values: generally unreliable, especially with more tests[^1]
>- Adjust using False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction

<!-- false negative -->

[^1]: See the [American Statistical Association statement on it](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)

```{r gee_model, cache=TRUE}
fit <- analyze_gee()
num_sig <- paste0(nrow(dplyr::filter(fit, unadj.p.value < 0.05)),
                  " non-FDR vs ",
                  nrow(dplyr::filter(fit, p.value < 0.05)),
                  " FDR")
```

## As conc, strong negative association with IS (`r num_sig` of `r nrow(fit)` models)

```{r gee_model_conc, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5}
fit %>% 
    dplyr::filter(unit %in% c('Totals', 'nmol/mL')) %>% 
    plot_gee_main()
```

## As mol%, very different story --- different FA have positive or negative roles

```{r gee_model_mol, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5}
fit %>% 
    dplyr::filter(unit %in% c('Totals', 'mol%')) %>% 
    plot_gee_main()
```

## But... GEE modeling is flawed

- TAG fatty acid composition in inherently multivariate

. . .

```{r fig_fattyacid_dnl}
grViz_Rmd("
digraph {
    node [shape = none]
    subgraph {
    rank = min; '14:0'; '16:0'; '18:0'; '20:0'
    }
    subgraph {
    rank = max; '14:1n7'; '16:1n7'; '18:1n9'
    }
    '14:0' -> {'16:0', '14:1n7'}; '16:0' -> {'18:0', '16:1n7'}
    '18:0' -> {'18:1n9', '20:0'}; '14:1n7' -> '16:1n7'
}
")
```

<!-- since each model can only include one TAG fatty acid, it ignores the
inherent fact that fatty acids can be converted from one length or saturation to
another through DNL. And so they are inherently linked to one another -->

## Correlation between TAG fatty acids

```{r fig_heatmap, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5}
analyze_corr() %>% 
    plot_heatmap()
```


## Partial Least Squares (PLS) allows for multivariate data

Takes:

$$ISI = 140 + 141n7 + ... + 225n3$$

Converts to:

$$ISI = Comp1 + Comp2$$

. . .

>- PLS: No p-value, no p-value problem
>- Cross-validation (CV) determines predictability
    - CV splits data into training and test sets
>- Flaw: Can only use one time point (cross-sectional)

## Four long chain fatty acids (14:0, 14:1n-7, 16:0, 16:1n-7) cluster and strongly explain the variance in metabolic function

```{r fig_pls, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
fit_is <- analyze_pls(y = 'lISI', ncomp = 2)
pred_is <- paste0(
    calc_pred_corr(fit_is, fit_is$test_data, ncomp = 1)$r,
    '-',
    calc_pred_corr(fit_is, fit_is$test_data, ncomp = 2)$r
)
fit_bcf <- analyze_pls(y = 'lISSI2', ncomp = 2)
pred_bcf <- paste0(
    calc_pred_corr(fit_bcf, fit_bcf$test_data, ncomp = 1)$r,
    '-',
    calc_pred_corr(fit_bcf, fit_bcf$test_data, ncomp = 2)$r
)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
    plot_pls(fit_is) + ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0('A: ISI\nPredictive: r = ', pred_is)), 
    plot_pls(fit_bcf) + ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0('B: ISSI-2\nPredictive: r = ', pred_bcf)), 
    ncol = 2)
```

## FA involved in DNL from higher carb intake associate with lower metabolic functioning

- Upregulated DNL, increased 14 and 16 chain fatty acids[^dnl]
    - 16:1n-7 shown to be highly related to directly measured DNL

. . .

- Two other cohort studies[^prospect] had similar findings for diabetes and
HOMA-IR.

<!-- simple statistics, not consider longitudinal design, or the multivariate
nature of the data -->

<!-- particularly with refined carbohydrates -->

[^dnl]: @Lee2015a; @Wilke2009a

## Overall conclusions of PhD research

- Each lipid fraction behaves slightly differently on metabolic functioning
- Fatty acids from DNL may contribute to metabolic dysfunction

. . .

- ...Make use of statistical and analytical advances
